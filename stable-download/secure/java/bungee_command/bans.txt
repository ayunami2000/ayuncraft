# This file allows you to configure bans for eaglercraftbungee
# When it is saved, eaglercraft should reload it automatically
# (check the console though to be safe)
#
# For a [Usernames] ban, just add the player's name. Use a colon ':' to put in a ban reason
# For a [IPs] ban, just add the player's IP, or a subnet like 69.69.0.0/16 to ban all IPs beginning with 69.69.*
# For a [Wildcards] ban, type a string and prefix and/or suffix it with * to define the wildcard
# For a [Regex] ban, type a valid regular expression in the java.util.regex format
#
# All bans are case-insensitive, USERNAMES ARE CONVERTED TO LOWERCASE BEFORE BEING MATCHED VIA REGEX
# Java regex syntax: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html
#

# set this to false to use "/eag-ban" to ban on bungee instead of just "/ban"
# (most likely needs a restart to take effect)
